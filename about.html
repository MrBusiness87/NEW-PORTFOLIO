      knowledge as possible. Driven, passionate, resourceful, witty, strategic, honest; just some of the words
      that describe me. Mainly, kind and helpful. I have always enjoyed working with computers, whether it was
      playing games, writing, reading, learning, teaching, manipulating, researching, I have always enjoyed the
      concept of a world connected. Wanting to be a bigger part of that world, I have started taking steps to
